# 528Lab-Servers
Welcome to the 528 Labs Computational Chemistry team! A must see before using the 528 Labs server.

This manual is written to include the use of Linux basics, how to link lab servers through ssh operations, and the use of Gaussian, VASP, and other computational software with a bibliography.

Must read before use: [SSH_access_to_the_server](https://github.com/Tenor-John/528Lab-Servers/blob/main/01-SSH_Link/SSH_access_to_the_server.md)
